# Express.js Route Handler Race Condition

This repository demonstrates a potential race condition in an Express.js route handler where an asynchronous operation might not complete before the response is sent.  This can lead to inconsistent behavior or errors if the data is not yet fetched before sending the response. The problem is more subtle if it involves internal asynchronous functions that don't have external service dependencies, making it less likely to be caught by standard testing.

## Bug Description
The bug lies in the asynchronous operation within the `/users/:id` route handler. If this operation takes longer than expected, the response is sent before the data is fully fetched, resulting in inconsistent results.

## Bug Solution
The solution is to ensure the asynchronous operation is fully completed before sending the response. This is achieved using asynchronous/await or promises to manage the asynchronous flow properly and preventing premature response.
